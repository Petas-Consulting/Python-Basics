# Operators in Python
# Arithmetic operators are used with numeric values to perform common mathematical operations:
'''
1. Addition(x + y)
2. Subtraction(x - y)
3. Multiplication(x * y)
4. Division(x / y)
5. Modulud(x % y)
6. Exponential(x ** y)
7. Floor Division(x // y)
'''
x = 7
y = 9

print(x + y)
print(x - y)
print(x * y)
print(x / y)
print(x % y)
print(x ** y)
print(x // y)


#Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables:
'''
Operator 	Example 	    Same As
= 	        x = 5 	        x = 5 	
+= 	        x += 3 	        x = x + 3 	
-= 	        x -= 3 	        x = x - 3 	
*= 	        x *= 3 	        x = x * 3 	
/= 	        x /= 3 	        x = x / 3 	
%= 	        x %= 3 	        x = x % 3 	
//= 	    x //= 3 	    x = x // 3 	
**= 	    x **= 3 	    x = x ** 3 	
&= 	        x &= 3 	        x = x & 3 	
|= 	        x |= 3 	        x = x | 3 	
^= 	        x ^= 3 	        x = x ^ 3 	
>>= 	    x >>= 3 	    x = x >> 3 	
<<= 	    x <<= 3 	    x = x << 3

Python Comparison Operators
Comparison operators are used to compare two values:

Operator 	Name 	                                Example 	
== 	        Equal 	                                x == y 	
!= 	        Not equal 	                            x != y 	
> 	        Greater than 	                        x > y 	
< 	        Less than 	                            x < y 	
>= 	        Greater than or equal to 	            x >= y 	
<= 	        Less than or equal to 	                x <= y
